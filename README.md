# Alexa_Skill_Azure_CosmosDB
The skill, which has been built, is for any user who has their data stored in Microsoftâ€™s Azure Cosmos-DB and would like to know the real-time value of any attribute of the same just by uttering some few words to Alexa Echo.

Alexa in its default is designed to work with the AWS backend services like AWS Lambda where the voice app is hosted however what we intend to provide to our customer is a voice experience for the Microsoft IOT solution so in order to achieve that we created a completely new Azure function and cosmos DB based Alexa skill.
So now our voice assistance application has a front end of Amazon while the processing is on Azure.
